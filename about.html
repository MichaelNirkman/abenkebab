<h2>The Finnish Dream
        </h2>
        <p>It all begun with a great idea. In 1968, a young man named Petri Paakari had returned from his long holiday throughout Europe.<br>Along the journey he had discovered a whole new culture of food, the wonders of kebab and pizza. Mr. Paakari was frustrated because there was nothing like it in his beloved home. That was the moment when Petri decided to change all this, and be the first finn to serve pizza and kebab in history.<br>Because of Paakari's striking similarities to president Abraham Lincoln in appearance, he decided to name his restaurant to "Abe's Kebab"</p>
        <p>The first kebab & pizza restaurant in the northern hemisphere was nothing but a humble shack located next to the Pasila railway station.<br>Paakari's primary point in his business was to provide as high-quality food as he possibly could.</p>

        <p><br>The word caught on quickly, that in Pasila one could get never before seen quisine that not only was exotic, but also tasted very good. The restaurant's reputation grew fast and expansions had to be made to get the supply match with the monstrous demand.<br>Luckily the local gas station just across the street had ended their business and offered their building for sale.<br>The new location is the one that we still reside on, staying true to the standards and morals of Petri Paakari.</p>
